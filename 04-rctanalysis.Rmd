# Analyzing RCT data {#rct-analysis}

We're now in the post-trial stage. The trial has been run, and we have lots of data to analyze to try to assess what affect the treatment or intervention has had.

We'll first focus on the scenario where the trial outcome is measured on a continuous scale, and then we'll go on to look at other types of data.

## Continuous outcome variable

### The simplest case - comparing means

### How to use baseline measurements

### ANCOVA

## Binary data

### Confidence intervals for binary data

### Using baseline measurements

## Categorical data?

Could mention Fisher's exact test, as demonstrated in the indo_rct data in the medicaldata package.

## Survival data
