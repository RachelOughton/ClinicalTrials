# Crossover / random effects thoughts

```{r}
# Possible examples:
epilepsy # good first one, no missing data

BtheB # needs reformatting, lots of missing data

ggpairs(select(BtheB, tidy_select::starts_with("bdi")), aes(col = BtheB$treatment), lower = list(continuous = "smooth"))


sleepstudy 
(fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), sleepstudy, subset=Days>=2))
## independent model - what does this notation mean?
(fm2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject) , sleepstudy, subset=Days>=2))
```

:::{.example}
Not sure whether to include this @terbinafine - 5 visits usually. @davis1991semi talks about longitudinal data analysis for non-normal response variables.

```{r}
# respiratory would also work
```

```{r glm-toenail, echo=T}
library(HSAUR3)
gm2 <- glmer(outcome~treatment*visit+(1|patientID),
                 data=toenail,
                 family=binomial,nAGQ=20)
```
