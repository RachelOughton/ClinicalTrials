# The Bayesian Approach 

Introduction - waht is the frequentist set up we've been doing and what can we really say? Deductive vs inductive reasoning.


Advantages of having a probability distribution about parameters (regions)


Prior, likelihood, posterior


Different sorts of prior
- why this can be a good thing

example - can I do streptomycin or some other early example? Or look in books? Don't spend too long on this!



Debate about whether decision theory should be included (by the fourth group of Bayesians) - argue not for same reasons as Spiegelhalter et.al - can't produce a definitively optimal solution, because there are lots of very different utilities involved.

Look into ethics of randomization - what even does this mean?

More complex trial designs - check with Nicole about mentioning design for CoP project.
